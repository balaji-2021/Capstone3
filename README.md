## Customer segmentation and recommendation system using the Online Retail dataset

Customer Segmentation is the strategy that is used to find discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. The idea behind customer segmentation is to split the user-base into smaller groups that can be targeted with specialized content and offers.
The purpose of the project is to understand:
* How can the data be preprocessed in order to correctly segment users into groups of similar people?
* What is a reasonable cluster size?
* What insights can we get from these cluster segments?
* How can the created clusters be used in the application to target users with specialized content e.g. item recommendations?
